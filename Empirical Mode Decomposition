An Intrinsic Mode Function can be defined as:

A function where:
1- The number of extrema and zero-crossings differ at most by 1
2- The mean of the local envelopes defined by its local maxima and by its local minima should be zero at all times.


In order to obtain an IMF, the following algorithm is followed:

1- Find all local extrema in the signal.
2- Join all local maxima with a cubic spline, creating an upper envelope. Join all local minima with a cubic spline, creating a lower envelope
3- Calculate the mean of the two envelopes
4- Subtract mean from original signals
5- Check if an IMF is obtained. If not, then repeat steps 1-4 until an IMF is obtained.
6- Subtract IMF from signal 
7- Repeat steps 1-6 until there are no more IMFs.

A library to perform IMFs in python is called PyHHT.
